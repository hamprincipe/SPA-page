<h2 id="tpoh" class="anchor">The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg</h1>
<p>
    In The Power of Habit, award-winning business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling
    edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed.
    Distilling vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives that take us from the boardrooms
    of Procter & Gamble to the sidelines of the NFL to the front lines of the civil rights movement,
    Duhigg presents a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential. At its core, The Power
    of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, being
    more productive, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. As Duhigg shows, by
    harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.

<h2 id="lotrd" class="anchor">Life on the Refrigerator Door: Notes Between a Mother and Daughter by Alice Kuipers</h1>
<p>
    Claire and her mother are running out of time, but they don't know it. Not yet. Claire is
    wrapped up with the difficulties of her bourgeoning adulthood—boys, school, friends, identity;
    Claire's mother, a single mom, is rushed off her feet both at work and at home. They rarely
    find themselves in the same room at the same time, and it often seems that the only thing they
    can count on are notes to each other on the refrigerator door. When home is threatened by a
    crisis, their relationship experiences a momentous change. Forced to reevaluate the delicate
    balance between their personal lives and their bond as mother and daughter, Claire and her
    mother find new love and devotion for one another deeper than anything they had ever imagined.
    Heartfelt, touching, and unforgettable, Life on the Refrigerator Door is a glimpse into the
    lives of mothers and daughters everywhere. In this deeply touching novel told through a series
    of notes written from a loving mother and her devoted fifteen-year-old daughter, debut author
    Alice Kuipers deftly captures the impenetrable fabric that connects mothers and daughters
    throughout the world. Moving and rich with emotion, Life on the Refrigerator Door delivers
    universal lessons about love in a wonderfully simple and poignant narrative.

<h2 id="tfpymih" class="anchor">The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom</h1>
<p>
    Eddie is a wounded war veteran, an old man who has lived, in his mind, an uninspired life.
    His job is fixing rides at a seaside amusement park. On his 83rd birthday, a tragic accident
    kills him, as he tries to save a little girl from a falling cart. He awakes in the afterlife,
    where he learns that heaven is not a destination. It's a place where your life is explained
    to you by five people, some of whom you knew, others who may have been strangers. One by one,
    from childhood to soldier to old age, Eddie's five people revisit their connections to him on
    earth, illuminating the mysteries of his "meaningless" life, and revealing the haunting secret
    behind the eternal question: "Why was I here?"

<h2 id="aart" class="anchor">An Absolutely Remarkable Thing by Hank Green</h1>
<p>
    In his wildly entertaining debut novel, Hank Green—cocreator of Crash Course, Vlogbrothers, and
    SciShow—spins a sweeping, cinematic tale about a young woman who becomes an overnight celebrity
    before realizing she's part of something bigger, and stranger, than anyone could have possibly
    imagined.<br />
    Carls just appeared.<br />
    Roaming through New York City at three a.m., twenty-three-year-old
    April May stumbles across a giant sculpture. Delighted by its appearance and craftsmanship—like a
    ten-foot-tall Transformer wearing a suit of samurai armor—April and her best friend, Andy, make a
    video with it, which Andy uploads to YouTube. The next day, April wakes up to a viral video and a
    new life. News quickly spreads that there are Carls in dozens of cities around the world—from Beijing
    to Buenos Aires—and April, as their first documentarian, finds herself at the center of an intense
    international media spotlight. Seizing the opportunity to make her mark on the world, April now has
    to deal with the consequences her new particular brand of fame has on her relationships, her safety,
    and her own identity. And all eyes are on April to figure out not just what the Carls are, but what
    they want from us. Compulsively entertaining and powerfully relevant, An Absolutely Remarkable Thing
    grapples with big themes, including how the social internet is changing fame, rhetoric, and radicalization;
    how our culture deals with fear and uncertainty; and how vilification and adoration spring for the same
    dehumanization that follows a life in the public eye. The beginning of an exciting fiction career, An
    Absolutely Remarkable Thing is a bold and insightful novel of now.

<h2 id="dw" class="anchor">Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World by Cal Newport</h1>
<p>
    Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill
    that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time.
    Deep Work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes
    from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive
    twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their
    days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there's a better way.
    In Deep Work, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age.
    Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing
    this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep
    work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as
    a series of four "rules," for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill.<br />
    1. Work Deeply<br />
    2. Embrace Boredom<br />
    3. Quit Social Media<br />
    4. Drain the Shallows<br />
    A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, Deep Work takes the reader on a journey through
    memorable stories-from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social
    media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction
    in the air-and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social
    media and that you should practice being bored. Deep Work is an indispensable guide to anyone seeking
    focused success in a distracted world.<br />
